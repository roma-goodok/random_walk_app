# Random Walk Application

This study is implemented  as a Course Project of ["Development Data Product" course](https://www.coursera.org/course/devdataprod) taught by *Brian Caffo, PhD* at <http://coursera.org>    

Application is a toy example of Gaussian Random Walk process simmulation that demonstrates how we can be blinded by optimizm when apply overfitted linear models to predict future outcomes for the time series. It is used as a model for real-world time series data such as financial markets.
